1
00:02.600 --> 00:04.880
Wake up to reality!

2
00:04.880 --> 00:09.650
Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.

3
00:09.650 --> 00:12.720
The longer you live, the more you realize

4
00:12.720 --> 00:15.890
that the only things that truly exist in this reality...

5
00:15.890 --> 00:19.890
are merely pain, suffering and futility.

6
00:19.890 --> 00:21.530
Listen,

7
00:21.530 --> 00:23.370
everywhere you look in this world,

8
00:23.370 --> 00:24.330
wherever there is light,

9
00:24.330 --> 00:27.880
there will always be shadows to be found as well.

10
00:27.880 --> 00:30.640
As long as there is a concept of victors,

11
00:30.640 --> 00:33.230
the vanquished will also exist.

12
00:33.230 --> 00:37.070
The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace,

13
00:37.070 --> 00:38.640
initiates wars...

14
00:38.640 --> 00:42.580
and hatred is born in order to protect love.

15
00:42.580 --> 00:43.720
There are nexuses...

16
00:43.720 --> 00:48.280
causal relationships that cannot be separated.

17
00:48.280 --> 00:52.690
I want to sever the fate of this world.

18
00:52.690 --> 00:55.330
A world of only victors.

19
00:55.330 --> 00:57.770
A world of only peace.

20
00:57.770 --> 01:01.610
A world of only love.

21
01:01.610 --> 01:07.910
I will create such a world.

22
01:07.910 --> 01:09.100
I am...

23
01:09.100 --> 01:11.840
the ghost of the Uchiha.

24
01:11.840 --> 01:20.330
...

25
01:20.330 --> 01:23.920
For truly this reality is a hell.

26
01:23.920 --> 01:28.360
...

27
01:28.360 --> 01:35.000
